The site was built in collaboration with Charles William to act as an interactive demo for his project - xG from CNNs. You can move the players and goalkeeper around and the model considers the spatial relations between all the opposition players, the shot location, and the goalkeeper's position to calculate an exepcted goals value (xG).
