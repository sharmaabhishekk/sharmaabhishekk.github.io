Mpl-footy is a collection/gallery of the most common types of plots seen in football analytics. The aim is for it to be a reference point for beginners to football analytics. Most of the plots are created using matplotlib. 

Mpl-footy is meant to be an open-source project. This means if you have an original plot that you'd like to add to the gallery, feel free to open a pull request. There's a contribution guide on the site, to help with the process.
