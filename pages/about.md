# **About Me**

Hi my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** and I'm from India. :wave:<br> 
I am currently finishing my masters in data science. I am also working as a data scientist at [**360Scouting**](https://360-scouting.com/). Apart from that, I am also available for consulting on short-term football analytics projects.

My interests include the various applications of statistics and machine learning in football. Besides the numbers, I'm also genuinely fascinated by the tactical side of the game, owing to my time as a writer/tactical analyst for Total Football Analysis.

Apart from football, I am fascinated by the applications of AI in general (especially computer vision). I am also into lifting and playing chess, though I suck at both equally. 

Come say hi on [twitter](https://twitter.com/abhisheksh_98/)!
